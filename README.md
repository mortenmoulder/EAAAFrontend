# EAAAFrontend Exam
Frontend exam for EAAA. This includes all my frontend development code.

## index.html
index.html contains the first page of the website. Since there is no actual homepage, but there is a "logo" linking to a homepage, this file could be named report.html instead.
The page is meant to be used as an "create report" page, where the user (in this case a janitor) can create a report and submit it.

## admin.html
admin.html contains the list of reports (including 3 dummy reports) as well as the options to remove them, sort through them, and searching through the list of reports as well.
